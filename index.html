DevOps Lifecycle
Eight continuous stages forming a feedback loop to deliver high‑quality software faster: Plan → Develop → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → (back to Plan)

Continuous Feedback


Plan — Define goals, scope, user stories, and priorities; create backlog and roadmap.
Develop — Write code, collaborate via branches/PRs, and follow coding standards.
Build — Compile, package, and generate artifacts using CI pipelines.
Test — Run unit, integration, and end‑to‑end tests; ensure quality gates pass.
Release — Version, sign, and approve artifacts; generate change logs.
Deploy — Roll out to environments using blue/green or canary strategies.
Operate — Run the app reliably with observability, backups, and SRE practices.
Monitor — Track KPIs, logs, and metrics; feed learnings back into planning.
